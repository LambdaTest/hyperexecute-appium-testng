# Steps to run Real Device Appium tests using HyperExecute

* [Pre-requisites](#pre-requisites)
   - [Download HyperExecute CLI](#download-hyperexecute-cli)
   - [Configure Environment Variables](#configure-environment-variables)
   
* [Navigation in Automation Dashboard](#navigation-in-automation-dashboard)

# Pre-requisites

Before using HyperExecute, you have to download HyperExecute CLI corresponding to the host OS. Along with it, you also need to export the environment variables *LT_USERNAME* and *LT_ACCESS_KEY* that are available in the [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

## Download HyperExecute CLI

HyperExecute CLI is the CLI for interacting and running the tests on the HyperExecute Grid. The CLI provides a host of other useful features that accelerate test execution. In order to trigger tests using the CLI, you need to download the HyperExecute CLI binary corresponding to the platform (or OS) from where the tests are triggered:

Also, it is recommended to download the binary in the project's parent directory. Shown below is the location from where you can download the HyperExecute CLI binary:

* Mac: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/darwin/hyperexecute
* Linux: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/linux/hyperexecute
* Windows: https://downloads.lambdatest.com/hyperexecute/windows/hyperexecute.exe

## Configure Environment Variables

Before the tests are run, please set the environment variables LT_USERNAME & LT_ACCESS_KEY from the terminal. The account details are available on your [LambdaTest Profile](https://accounts.lambdatest.com/detail/profile) page.

For macOS:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Linux:

```bash
export LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
export LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

For Windows:

```bash
set LT_USERNAME=LT_USERNAME
set LT_ACCESS_KEY=LT_ACCESS_KEY
```

## Navigation in Automation Dashboard

HyperExecute lets you navigate from/to *Test Logs* in Automation Dashboard from/to *HyperExecute Logs*. You also get relevant get relevant Selenium test details like video, network log, commands, Exceptions & more in the Dashboard. Effortlessly navigate from the automation dashboard to HyperExecute logs (and vice-versa) to get more details of the test execution.

Shown below is the HyperExecute Automation dashboard which also lists the tests that were executed as a part of the test suite:
